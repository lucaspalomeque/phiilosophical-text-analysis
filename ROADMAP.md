## üìä IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### **Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Create ROADMAP.md file** ‚úÖ
2. **Choose Phase 1A or 1B** for next session
3. **Set up development branch** for chosen phase
4. **Create detailed implementation plan** for selected phase

### **Development Principles:**
- üß™ **Test-driven development** for all new features
- üìö **Comprehensive documentation** for each component  
- üîç **Scientific rigor** in all statistical analyses
- üé® **User experience focus** for visualizations
- üîÑ **Iterative improvement** based on results

### **Success Metrics:**
- **Phase 1**: 100% replication accuracy of original paper
- **Phase 2**: Compelling visual presentations ready for sharing
- **Phase 3**: Novel philosophical insights published
- **Phase 4**: Research tool used by other academics

## üéØ DECISION POINTS

### **Which Phase to tackle next?**

**Option A: Scientific Rigor First**
- ‚úÖ Builds credibility
- ‚úÖ Ensures solid foundation  
- ‚ùå Less immediately exciting

**Option B: Visual Impact First**
- ‚úÖ More shareable results
- ‚úÖ Immediate gratification
- ‚ùå Might build on shaky foundation

**Option C: Philosophy Innovation First**
- ‚úÖ Most unique contribution
- ‚úÖ Novel research potential
- ‚ùå Harder to validate without solid base

### **Recommended Sequence:**
1. **Phase 1A** (Advanced Paper Metrics) - 2-3 days
2. **Phase 2A** (Advanced Visualizations) - 3 days  
3. **Phase 1B** (Scientific Validation) - 2 days
4. **Phase 3A** (Philosophy-Specific Metrics) - 3-4 days

## üìù SESSION NOTES

### **Current Findings to Investigate:**
- **Nietzsche coherence anomaly**: Why is "Beyond Good and Evil" more coherent than expected?
- **Kant complexity**: Does high conceptual complexity reduce measured coherence?
- **Sample size effects**: How do results change with more texts per philosopher?

### **Questions for Future Research:**
1. How does translation affect coherence measurements?
2. Can we detect philosophical influence through coherence patterns?
3. Do different philosophical themes show different coherence patterns?
4. How does text length affect coherence stability?
