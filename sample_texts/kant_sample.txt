The supreme principle of all synthetic judgments is therefore this: every object stands under the necessary conditions of synthetic unity of the manifold of intuition in a possible experience.

Synthetic a priori judgments are thus possible when we refer the formal conditions of a priori intuition, the synthesis of imagination and the necessary unity of this synthesis in a transcendental apperception, to a possible empirical knowledge in general.

The transcendental unity of apperception is that unity through which all the manifold given in an intuition is united in a concept of the object.
